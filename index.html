I have done lots of different jobs in the trucking industry, I have loads of knowledge in the trucking industry I have driven in 23 different states I've also lived in Colorado and drove the mountains of that State that was fun After all the years I decided it was time to make the next move I started my own my trucking Company in 2021 call EveryDayLyfe trucking.</p>

         <h3>Design & develop website's</h3>
         <p class="design">I started to learn about computers when I was 9 years old I took a computer apart in computer class and from that Day forward I have always wanted to design & develop websites at 20 years old I came out with my first social media website called jigMeister A few people got to see the demo version but unfortunate the world did not get a chance to see it and that's why I'm returning to my first love so that I can bring all my creativity to the world and that's designing and developing websites.</p>
